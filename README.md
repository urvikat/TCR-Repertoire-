# TCR-Repertoire-
#The code for the project report, which splits the dataset into the MAIT Cell dataset, Sample dataset and Control dataset.
#A series of graphs are plotted for each dataset, to show the change in the number of TCR-alpha and those that are condisered as MAIT Cells, the change in the frequencies and proportions of MAIT Cells.
#Variances for the frequencies and proportions of MAIT Cells are calculated and statistical tests are performed.
